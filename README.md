## Description

My motivation for this task was to be a able to create a more sematic HTML page, to make it easier for someone who was reading the code for the first time to understand what each section repersented. What i learned was to add semantic tags to elements to better repersent what it supposed to do and also learning to structure the page, as well as learning to add alt tags that could benefit the visually impared so that they are able to know what the image is.
